title: "Across the sands of my strawberry dream"

Vaguely filling fragmented air
driftwood sparking, vivid flare
empty winds, nothing to share
lonesome evenings under the moon
all in time have wandered there



Time shifted to a blooming dandelion
scattering light reflecting through floating pieces
emenating, an atmospheric sign
renting from earth, renewing leases



HE is, SHE is,
a home I once wandered through
on the walls, reminders grew
sometimes three, four, atleast two
he is enough, she is enough, we are enough
faded blue

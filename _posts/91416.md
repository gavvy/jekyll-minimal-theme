title: "Across the sands of my strawberry dream"


Vaguely filling fragmented air
driftwood sparking, vivid flare
empty winds, nothing to share
lonesome evenings under the moon
all in time have wandered there



Time shifted to a blooming dandelion
scattering light reflecting through floating pieces
emenating, and atmospheric sign
renting from earth, renewing leases
